@description: This is the employee class created as per the question for the
              Classes Exercise Question.
@question: Create a class called Employee that includes three instance
           variables — a firstname (type String), a lastname (type String) and
           a monthly salary (float). Provide a constructor that initializes
           the three instance variables. Provide set and get methods for
           each instance variable. If the monthly salary is not positive, do
           not set its value. Create a method raiseSalary which raises the
           salary of the employee by 10%. Also create a method getAnnualSalary
           which returns the employee's annual salary.

           Write a test app named EmployeeTest that demonstrates class
           Employee’s capabilities.

           Create two Employee objects and display each object’s yearly salary.
           Then give each Employee a 10% raise and display each Employee’s
           yearly salary again.
