@description: This is the Invoice class created as per the question for the
              Classes Exercise Question.
@question: Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to
           represent an invoice for an item sold at the store.

           An Invoice should include four pieces of information as instance
           variables—a partNumber, a partDescription, a quantity of the item
           being purchased and a price per item.

           Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four
           instance variables. Provide set and get methods for each instance
           variable.

           In addition, provide a method named getInvoiceAmount that calculates
           the invoice amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per
           item), then returns the amount as a float value.
             > If the quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0.
             > If the price per item is not positive, it should be set to 0.
           Write a test app named InvoiceTest that demonstrates class Invoice’s
           capabilities.
